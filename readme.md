# learn [hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org) with tests

very WIP!

the best way to learn, write a test, see what happens

- make static files experimenting with hyperscript
- have a test that executes the code and documents what it does

## to run

You'll need to start the static server with `npm start`.

To run the tests `npm test`
